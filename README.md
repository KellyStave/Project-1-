## Covid Timeline Analysis
Despite a lockdown renewed on December 3rd in California, the cases grew dramatically during the holiday season. This makes sense assuming people are shopping, traveling and coming in contact with more people during this time.

During the surge, the biggest dip in daily cases was on December 25th, 2020. We conclude that people did not check, themselves in  because of Christmas. This leads to the highest number of cases recorded the following day on December 26th, 2020. The day after Christmas day recorded 64,986 new covid cases.

The growth of Covid cases and low vaccine distributions results to an increase in deaths in the early months of 2021. The spike in deaths reaching 1,084 deaths on February 24th, 2022.

## Weekly COVID cases and death analysis
Our data set began on July 1 2020 of note on June 15, 2020 51/58 counties in California had reopened with optional face coverings. 
We see that beginning in July there was an increase in the number of new cases and deaths that continued into August. 

On July 13 30 counties were again shut down due to the July increases, resulting in a decrease in new cases and deaths in August. This decrease in cases continued until September 16 when the lowest number of new cases was recorded. As a result of the decrease businesses were again allowed to reopen beginning in October. 

In November we begin to see a sharp increase in number of new cases and deaths which continues through the end of 2020 nad into 2021. On November 16 all non-essential businesses in Los Angeles county are closed and the mask mandate is reinstated.

On December 23 there Los Angeles county is at 0% capacity for ICU beds and there is a shortage of PPE, by December 26 the ICU bed shortage is statewide. This shortage paired with an O2 shortage negatively impacts survivability for those patients requiring ICU level care.
