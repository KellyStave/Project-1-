## Covid Timeline Analysis
Despite a lockdown renewed on December 3rd in California, the cases grew dramatically during the holiday season. This makes sense assuming people are shopping, traveling and coming in contact with more people during this time.

During the surge, the biggest dip in daily cases was on December 25th, 2020. We conclude that people did not check, themselves in  because of Christmas. This leads to the highest number of cases recorded the following day on December 26th, 2020. The day after Christmas day recorded 64,986 new covid cases.
